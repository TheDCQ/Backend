          <p>A lot of people, especially students from all around the world are competing in programming events like IOI or ACM-ICPC. <br>Having Algorithmic and Data Structure knowledge is a must for all Computer Science jobs, and by competing in this kind of events, students become masters of these. </p>

          <p>There are many ways to prepare for competitive programming, but the best piece of advice someone can ever give you is: Practice. Practice. Practice. Every. Single. Day.</p>

          <p>Sure, it is really important to study lots of algorithms and data structures. But without practice you are no better than a book!</p>

          <p>There are lots of ways to practice, for example:</p>
